    Cobalt Strike's http-config block applies to every HTTP response the
    listener emits, regardless of which http-get/http-post/http-stager
    URI the request hit.

    Attributes:
        trust_x_forwarded_for (bool): when True, the listener honors the
            ``X-Forwarded-For`` header and treats the first entry as the
            real client IP. **Defaults to False** — defaulting to True is
            a spoofing vector since the header is attacker-controllable
            unless there is a trusted upstream proxy.
        block_useragents (tuple[str, ...]): fnmatch-style globs
            (``curl*``, ``wget*``) normalized to lowercase + deduplicated
            at parse time. The listener applies them case-insensitively
            against the request ``User-Agent``; a match returns 404
            before any agent logic runs. Globs — not full regex — to
            avoid operator-supplied ReDoS patterns from public CS
            profiles. The listener also caps UA bytes before matching.
        headers (list[tuple[str, str]]): default response headers merged
            into every non-blocked Flask response. (The UA-block 404 path
            intentionally bypasses this merge to avoid signaling that
            blocking is in effect.)
        header_order (list[str]): the ``set headers "A, B, C";``
            directive declares ordering for the named headers. Recorded
            for inspection; the underlying Flask/Werkzeug stack does not
            expose a way to enforce ordering, so the listener emits an
            INFO note at startup when this is declared.

    Note on `_parse` semantics: `header` directives **accumulate** (each
    occurrence appends), while `set block_useragents` and `set headers`
    **replace** (a later occurrence overrides the earlier value, matching
    CS profile conventions).
